This repository contains documents associated with my merit and tenure process
as a Lecturer with (Potential) Security of Employment at the University of
California, Davis in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department.

I'm releasing this information to be as open and transparent as possible about
the tenure process so that it can hopefully help others in similar positions.
I'm also happy to get any feedback.
