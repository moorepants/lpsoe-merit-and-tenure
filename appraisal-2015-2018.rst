Teaching and Learning
=====================

- Standard courses: ENG 122, EME 134, EME 171, EME 185, MAE 223
- Hoping to teach other existing dynamics, biomechanics, and control courses.
- Hope to create a new course, for example:

  - undergraduate and/or graduate engineering software development and
    computing
  - undergraduate and/or graduate computational biomechanics
  - undergraduate and/or graduate applied robotics

- Plan to start working with department faculty to introduce teaching and
  learning best practices into our other courses through personal and small
  group efforts.
- Launching a JupyterHub service for the entire UCD campus for instructional
  use.
- Continue to grow Meijo/UCD design competition as a part of EME 185 and
  potentially initiative a study abroad summer program.
- Continue participating in the UCD Engineering Education Learning Community.
- Interested in revamping EME 185.

Professional Achievement and Activities
=======================================

- 2018-2021: Working on as CO-PI on Libretexts $5M Dept. of Edu. grant
  producing interactive open access engineering textbooks and employing 5-10
  undergraduates throughout the 3 years.
- Continue work on ENG 122 and MAE 223 interactive textbooks.
- Will continue to develop and give the workshop "Computational Thinking in the
  Engineering Curriculum" to UCD, at conferences, and other schools.
- Research will continue in:

  - Rowing biomechanics (1 journal pub being submitted now and new projects
    started)
  - Bicycle engineering (3 conference papers this coming year and 1 journal pub
    this year)
  - Skiing safety (2 journal pubs this and last year and 1 conference paper this
    year)
  - Human motion and control (2 journal pubs in progress)

- Continue as section editor for the Journal of Open Source Education and the
  Journal of Open Engineering

University and Public Service
=============================

- Grow in work with undergraduate committee and play larger role in the MAE
  curriculum development.
- Help lead the MAE website forward.
- Continue to develop open source software (SymPy, PyDy, conda-forge packages,
  etc)
