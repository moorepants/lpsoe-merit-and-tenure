Teaching and Learning
=====================

Teaching and learning constitutes approximately 60% to 70% of my job. Over the
past two years I taught thirteen UCD courses (three of which were new course
preparations and one was a complete course redesign): `ENG 122`_ (Introduction
to Vibrations) Fall 2016 & 2017, `EME 150A`_ (Mechanical Design) Fall 2017, two
sections of `EME 185A/B`_ (Mechanical Systems Design Project) Winter-Spring
2017 & 2018, `MAE 223`_ (Multibody Dynamics) Fall 2017, and `MAE 297`_
(Graduate Seminar) Spring 2017. This 6 course per year load is higher than the
recommended 4-5 courses for L(P)SOE's by the vice provost and the Dean. I have
put considerable effort into incorporating evidenced backed educational
practices, moving torwards active learning, modernizing the materials as part
of my classroom innovations long-term goal.

Evidence Based Educational Practices
------------------------------------

I strive to incorporate teaching practices that have strong evidence of
improving student learning. The following lists practices I employ across all
of my courses:

- utilize learning objective mastery rubric-based assessment,
- use exam reflection surveys,
- increase the amount of in-class active learning and decrease in-class lecture,
- collect weekly feedback from the students and respond to this via extra
  in-class content, extra videos and/or written notes,
- post all notes, videos,
- release the vast majority of my teaching materials as open educational
  resources under liberal copyright licenses

EME 150A [Mechanical Design]
----------------------------

I taught this course for the second time with teaching assistant Destiny
Garcia. We made use of the Unitrans Bike Rack design project I developed the
prior year and added a `lesson on lightweight prototyping`_ in addition to the
Unitrans maintenance facility visit. The students gave lightning talks for
their projects and we developed a set of rubrics for grading the project memos,
reports, and presentations. This project has been used by Prof. Jiancheng Liu
in the University of Pacific, Stockton's course. Lastly, I have mentored two
Google Summer of Code students in the development of a `2D Beam Bending
software package`_ for future computational learning use in the course.

ENG 122 [Introduction to Mechanical Vibrations]
-----------------------------------------------

I taught this course twice during the period. In the first offering I developed
a weekly one hour in-class computational learning module, introducing 40 hours
of active learning based on live coding and a series of Jupyter notebooks.
After the first offering, I applied to the UCD Center for Educational
Effectiveness for a grant and was awarded $22k to transform ENG 122 into a
fully active learning based course, along with an interactive Jupyter based
open access textbook, computational based homeworks, move to project based
assignments, and to setup computational infrastructure for the course and the
College. Kenneth Lyons and I were funded through this grant and his teaching
assistantship to develop this. We successfully accomplished these goals and
have presented the work locally and nationally as invited speakers to SacPy,
the UCD College of Education Graduate Group Seminar, SciPy 2018, and JupyterCon
2018. This work also led into the development of a workshop with my colleague
Allen Downey, on Teaching Through Computational Learning. Since these
initiatives I have been asked by half a dozen professors on campus to help them
with similar instructional needs and Valeria La Saponora has adopted the
Jupyter tool for her composites course.

EME 185A/B [Mechanical Systems Design Project]
----------------------------------------------

Over the past two years of EME 185 I have significantly increased the amount of
time each team gets direct mentorship from myself and the teaching assistants.
I have pushed for more TAs per team (decreased to 7 teams per TA from the
initial 15 team per TA) and have created an increased percentage lead TA
position. During the Spring quarter the twenty-two teams each met with
instructors for 50 minutes each week (up from 25 minutes in 2015). I believe
this is directly correlated with the students learning and the resulting
quality of the students' work.

The teaching assistants and I have developed numerous improvements to the
course. There are a set of mostly practical skills that students struggle with
each year and we've come up with a series of learning modules that help address
these: technical report writing, CAD based finite element analysis, 3D
printing, project management with modern cloud services, an introduction to
micro-controllers. These are in addition to the design process learning modules
which I have converted to active learning.

We have developed a 15 page `instructor guide`_ for the course that provides
week-by-week tasks for all of the involved instructors. We have improved the
assessment drastically with a comprehensive set of learning objective mastery
based rubrics for all of the written and oral assignments. These have been
utilized for Canvas based ABET assessments. This past year we introduced Canvas
quizzes for the reading materials to support the active learning in class.
Lastly, I've enhanced the student peer evaluation process with CATME and custom
software. In particular, we provide anonymized vies of the teams peer scores
four times throughout the course to help quickly identify struggling teams.

I have also worked to improve the project solicitation to gain new industry
partners and to strengthen continued relationships with established
relationships. I have improved the professional presentation through a
solicitation website and a curated mailing list of 400+ potential sponsors.
Steve Velinsky and I have recruited 66 projects over the past two years that
provided approximately $Xk of project funding. X were industry, X were
non-profit, X were ...

After the 2017 course, I went with two students to deploy their water
sanitation project on the Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia, which was funded through
two student awarded Blum Center Grants and a CITRIS Tech for Social Good Grant.

Another very exciting element of this course is an exchange and design
competition I have developed with my collaborators at Meijo University.

we have developed a design competition
and exchange program. Around 18 Japanese students have visited Davis over three
trips and we took 12 UCD students to Japan this past summer under a $24k Global
Affairs Seed grant.

MAE 223 [Multibody Dynamics]
----------------------------

I cannot express how much I enjoyed teaching this course. I came out of each
class so excited because I love the material so much. Due to the heavy load in
ENG 122 described, I mostly followed past offerings. But I did swap out most
chalkboard examples with computational examples through live coding and active
exercises using a modern alternative to Autolev (the prior software used in
this course) that I co-developed and maintain. This resulted in X Jupyter
notebooks that can be turned into a companion interactive text as years
progress. I developed new lectures to provide students an introduction to
trajectory optimization. Additionally, I made all of the lecture videos and
course materials available on Youtube for public use.

MAE 297 [Graduate Seminar]
--------------------------

I had a few goals for my offering of MAE 297: 1) increase the diversity
(industry/academic, gender, age, etc) of the speakers and the topics, 2)bring as
many speakers as possible from outside UCD, and 3) initiate a method to share
the talks with the world. I developed a course website to highlight the speaker
schedule and biographies.  I obtained permission from most of the speakers to
post their talks publicly to Youtube.

Guest lectures
--------------

I gave guest lectures in EME 1 (Kong), ECS 198 (Kornbluth), and scored ENG 3
(van der Ghyst) projects.

Mentoring
---------

During this period I mentored six graduate students (1 as primary MSc advisor,
2 as an MSc committee member, 1 as a GSR advisor, and 1 as Google Summer of
Code mentor). My primary advisee, Abe McKay, completed his MSc, doing field
work in Kenya funded through a Blum Center Grant and collaborating with the
non-profit World Bicycle Relief. I mentored 5 teaching assistants. I have also
mentored 3 post graduate and 11 undergraduate researchers on various projects.
One of the post-graduates, Scott Kresie, wrote a paper and presented at ICSC
2017. Lastly, I mentored two students teams. The Solar Boat Team took 2nd place
at both the 2017 and 2018 competitions, has secured external funding close to
$10k, and has grown to a 20+ member, popular team. The Quadrapeligic Friendly
Tricycle Team raised over $18k and completed their tricycle design.

Professional Achievements and Activities
========================================

This topic represents 20% to 30% of my work and a variety of activities can
fulfill this, for example: writing textbooks, writing/reviewing pedagogical
focused proposals, research on pedagogy, engineering research in my discipline,
presenting at conferences, participation in professional organizations, etc.

I am quite happy to have co-authored a paper on version 1.0 of the computer
aided algebra system SymPy, which I have been a core developer of for the past
decade, in PeerJ Computational Sciences. In just over a year we already have
130+ citations and it was named as the top cited paper in all of PeerJ's
publications for 2017. I also published a paper in the Journal of Open Source
Software on a software package I developed that allows a user to solve optimal
control and parameter identification problems with direct collocation by simply
specifying the high level mathmatrical form of the problem. Once specified,
automatic code generation takes care of creating efficient algorithms in
compiled C code to solve the non-linear programming problem. Note that I
attempt to strictly publish in Open Access avenues, as an ethical imperative.

The second highlight of the past two years was being the lead organizer and
host of the 2017 International Cycling Safety Conference. With Deb Neimer, Mont
Hubbard, and Susan Handy as co-organizers we brought over 170 international
visitors in for the conference. We partnered with the UCD National Center for
Sustainable Transportation, the City of Davis, multiple bicycle companies, and
local advocacy groups to pull it off. This resulted in over 90 peer reviewed
short papers, 60 presentations, 30 posters, and 2 workshops and the best work
of the conference will be published in a special issue of the Journal of
Somethinganother. Additionall, the keynotes highlighted a long standing
detriment to bicycle saftety that is socially accepted in policy decsions but
has not scientific backing to support it. This resulted in a number of media
peiceas on the topic in NPR, etc, and etc.

I attended multiple confernces: BMD 2016, SciPy 2017, ICSC 2017, SOTL 2017 &
2018.

I was or students I mentored were awarded 10 different grants during this
period. I was rejected on two $3M large collaborative grants to the NSF, but
received favroable reviews and the proposals will be resubmitted.

I was co-granted funds as a mentoring organization totalling $64k from Google
Summer of Code to support nine undergraduate students through SymPy_ and the
Python Software Foundation for the summer of 2016. I mentored two students in
2015 and two students in 2016 through this program. I also play a lead
developer role in the open source software packages SymPy_ and PyDy_ which have

I have developed collaborations over the past two years with Allen Downey,
Andrew Hall (World Bicycle Relief), Paul Crawford (Hegemony Technologies),
Anthony Scopatz (University of South Carolina), Kyle Niemer (Oregon State),
Zhiu, Delmar Larsen

University and Public Service
=============================

University and public service amounts to approximately 10% of my work. I have
played a service roll in several internal initiatives and also extended my
pro-bono services to the public through talks, interviews, and workshops.

During the review period I have served on the MAE Undergraduate committee and
on the MAE Website committee. I also worked with Jenny Quynn and Steven Win....
to develop several ABET assessments for EME 185 for the 2018 review. I created
and presented a talk for decision day and was the Master of Ceremony for the
MAE Master's students at the 2018 commencement. I also sadly had to deal with
two deaths this past year. The Quadrapeligc Friendly Tricycle Team's sponsor,
Greg Tanner, passed away after a long battle with ALS. I accompanied four of
the team members to Greg's funeral and spent time. And as you all know, Josepth
Goodwin, passed away just weeks before graduation. I worked with a lot of the
affected students to put together a memorial gathering for them and him. I
believe this was helpful for the students' grieving.

I also engaged with the public in a number of ways this review period. I spoke
at visit of Laguna High School students organized by Barbara Linke for her NSF
funded course and spoke at the Sacramento Python Users Group (SacPy) about my
educational efforts that utlized the Python programming language. I was
interviewed several times about the ICSC 2017 confrence for NPR and other news
outlets. The Huffiginton Post and the The New York Times interviewed us about
our work on bicycle dynamics and control. I also arranged tours for around 30
students to Technip FMC and DMG Mori last spring to further build our
relationships with them. Lastly, the workshops at SciPy 2017, SciPy 2017, and
the workshop for the Delta Stewardship Council, Department of Water Resrouces,
and the California EPA provided non-academics with modern computational skills.

Acknowledgements
================

I know this document is supposed to be about my accomplishments but I think it
is important to note the people that contributed to the success of the above
mentioned activities. Case van Dam, the chair, was very supportive of getting
me off on good footing and enabling some of my ideas. The MAE staff has been
superb in their support and help, especially with the MAE Design Studio work.
In particular Felicia Smith, Dave Richardson, Jacob Kitada, Loan-Anh Nguyen,
and Rob Kamisky played important roles. My teaching assistants, Matthew Lefort
and Farhad Ghadamli, were excellent. I couldn't have done any of the extra
classroom innovations without their help and great ideas. I've had two
excellent undergraduate assistants: Vivian Tran and Braden Tinucci. Both
Michael Hill and Steven Velinsky have been especially helpful and attentive
mentors. I also appreciate the dedication and time contributed by all of the
EME |_| 185 project sponsors. And finally, I thank the SymPy and PyDy
development teams.
