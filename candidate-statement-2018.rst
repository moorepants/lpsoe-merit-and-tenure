Teaching and Learning
=====================

Teaching and learning constitutes approximately 60% to 70% of my job. Over the
past two years I taught thirteen UCD courses (three of which were new course
preparations and one was a complete overhaul): `ENG 122`_ (Introduction to
Vibrations) Fall 2016 & 2017,`EME 150A`_ (Mechanical Design) Fall 2017, two
sections of `EME 185A/B`_ (Mechanical Systems Design Project) Winter-Spring
2017 & 2018, `MAE 223`_ (Multibody Dynamics) Fall 2017, and `MAE 297`_
(Graduate Seminar) Spring 2017. I have put considerable effort into
incorporating evidenced backed educational practices, active learning,
modernizing the material and methods as part of my classroom innovations
long-term goal.

Evidence Based Educational Practices
------------------------------------

In all of the courses I have taught, I:

- utilize learning objective mastery rubric-based assessment,
- use exam reflection surveys,
- increase the amount of in-class active learning and decrease in-class lecture,
- collect weekly feedback from the students and respond to this via extra
  in-class content, extra videos and/or written notes,
- post all notes, videos,
- release the vast majority of my teaching materials as open educational
  resources under liberal copyright licenses

EME 150A [Mechanical Design]
----------------------------

I taught this course for the second time with teaching assistant Destiny
Garcia. We made use of the Unitrans Bike Rack design project I developed the
prior year and added a `lesson on lightweight prototyping`_, see the EELC
blogpost for details, in addition to the Unitrans maintenance facility visit.
The students gave lightning talks for their projects and we developed a set of
rubrics for grading the project memos, reports, and presentations. This project
has been used by Prof. Jiancheng Liu in the University of Pacific, Stockton's
course. Lastly, I have mentored two Google Summer of Code students in the
development of a `2D Beam Bending software package`_ for future computational
learning use in the course.

ENG 122 [Introduction to Mechanical Vibrations]
-----------------------------------------------

I taught this course twice. During the first offering I developed a weekly one
hour in-class computational learning module, for 40 hours of active learning
based on a series of Jupyter notebooks. I then applied to the CEE for a
teaching with tech grant and was awarded $22k to transform ENG 122 into a fully
active learning based course, along with an interactive Jupyter based open
access textbook, computational based homeworks, move to project based
assignments, and to setup computational infastructure for the course and the
College. Kenneth Lyons and I were funded through this grant and his teaching
assistantship to develop this. We sucessfully accomplished these goals and have
presented the work locally and nationally as invited speakers to SacPy, the UCD
College of Education Graduate Group Seminar, SciPy 2018, and JupyterCon 2018.
This work also led into the development of a workshop with my colleague Allen
Downey, on Teaching Through Computational Learning. Since these intitiatives I
have been asked by half a dozen professors on campus to help them with similar
instructional needs and Valeria La Saponora has adopted the Jupyter tool for
her composites course.

EME 185A/B [Mechanical Systems Design Project]
----------------------------------------------

The past two years of EME 185 I have significantly increase the amount of time
each team gets direct mentorship from the teaching assistants and me. I have
pushed for more TAs per team (15/TA first year down to 7/TA the past two years)
and have an increased percentage lead TA position now. During the Spring
quarter the twenty-two teams each meet with me for 50 minutes each week (up
from 25 minutes). I believe this is directly correlated with the quality of the
students' work.

The teaching assistants and I have developed numerous improvements to the
course. There are a set of mostly practical skills that students struggle with
each year and we've come up with a set of learning modules that help address
these: technical report writing, CAD based finite element analysis, 3D
printing, project management with modern cloud services, an introduction to
microcontrollers in addition to the design process learning modules which are
all now based on active learning practices in the winter labs.

We have developed a 15 page `instructor guide`_ for the course that provides
week-by-week tasks for all of the involved instructors. We have improved the
assessment drastically with a comprehensive set of learning object based
rubrics for all written and oral assignments that have been utilized for Canvas
based ABET assessments. This past year we introduced Canvas quizzes for the
reading materials. Lastly, I've enhanced the student peer evaluation process
with CATME and we provide anonymized vies of the teams peer scores four times
throughout the course.

I have also worked to improve the project solicitation and to strengthen
continues relationships with companies. I have improved the professional
presentation through a solicitation website and curated mailing list of 400+
potential sponsors. Steve Velinsky and I have recruited 66 projects over the
past two years that provide $X of project funding. X were industry, X were
non-profit, X were ...

With my counterparts at Meijo University we have developed a design competition
and exchange program. Around 18 Japanese students have visited Davis over three
trips and we took 12 UCD students to Japan this past summer under a $24k Global
Affairs Seed grant.

After the 2017 course I went with two students to deploy their water sanitation
project on the Tonle Sap lake in Cambodia, which was funded through two Blum
Center Grants.

MAE 223 [Multibody Dynamics]
----------------------------

I cannot express how much I enjoyed teaching this course. I came out of each
class so excited because I love the material so much. Due to the heavy load in
ENG 122 described, I mostly followed past offerings. But I did swap out most
chalkboard examples with computational examples through live coding and active
exercises using a modern alternative to Autolev (the prior software used in
this course) that I co-developed and maintain. This resulted in X Jupyter
notebooks that can be turned into a companion interactive text as years
progress. I developed new lectures to provide students an introduction to
trajectory optimization. Additionally, I made all of the lecture videos and
course materials available on Youtube for public use.

MAE 297 [Graduate Seminar]
--------------------------

I had a few goals for my offering of MAE 297: 1) increase the diversity
(industry/academic, gender, age, etc) of the speakers and the topics, 2)bring as
many speakers as possible from outside UCD, and 3) initiate a method to share
the talks with the world. I developed a course website to highlight the speaker
schedule and biographies.  I obtained permission from most of the speakers to
post their talks publicly to Youtube.

Guest lectures
--------------

- guest lecture in EME 1 (Kong) Nov 28
- guest lecture in Kurt's class
- guest scorer in Jean's ENG 3

Mentoring
---------

I have mentored five graduate students (1 primary thesis advisor, 2 committee,
2 as GSR advisors), three completed their MSc degrees.

Professional Achievements and Activities
========================================

This topic represents 20% to 30% of my work and a variety of activities can
fulfill this, for example: writing textbooks, writing/reviewing pedagogical
focused proposals, research on pedagogy, engineering research in my discipline,
presenting at conferences, participation in professional organizations, etc.

I am quite happy to have co-authored a paper on version 1.0 of the computer
aided algebra system SymPy, which I have been a core developer of for the past
decade, in PeerJ Computational Sciences. In just over a year we already have
130+ citations and it was named as the top cited paper in all of PeerJ's
publications for 2017. I also published a paper in the Journal of Open Source
Software on a software package I developed that allows a user to solve optimal
control and parameter identification problems with direct collocation by simply
specifying the high level mathmatrical form of the problem. Once specified,
automatic code generation takes care of creating efficient algorithms in
compiled C code to solve the non-linear programming problem. Note that I
attempt to strictly publish in Open Access avenues, as an ethical imperative.

The second highlight of the past two years was being the lead organizer and
host of the 2017 International Cycling Safety Conference. With Deb Neimer, Mont
Hubbard, and Susan Handy as co-organizers we brought over 170 international
visitors in for the conference. We partnered with the UCD National Center for
Sustainable Transportation, the City of Davis, multiple bicycle companies, and
local advocacy groups to pull it off. This resulted in over 90 peer reviewed
short papers, 60 presentations, 30 posters, and 2 workshops and the best work
of the conference will be published in a special issue of the Journal of
Somethinganother. Additionall, the keynotes highlighted a long standing
detriment to bicycle saftety that is socially accepted in policy decsions but
has not scientific backing to support it. This resulted in a number of media
peiceas on the topic in NPR, etc, and etc.

I attended multiple confernces: BMD 2016, SciPy 2017, ICSC 2017, SOTL 2017 &
2018.

I was co-granted funds as a mentoring organization totalling $64k from Google
Summer of Code to support nine undergraduate students through SymPy_ and the
Python Software Foundation for the summer of 2016. I mentored two students in
2015 and two students in 2016 through this program. I also play a lead
developer role in the open source software packages SymPy_ and PyDy_ which have
.. _2017 International Cycling Safety Conference: https://icsc2017.ucdavis.edu

I have developed collaborations over the past two years with Allen Downey,
Andrew Hall, Paul Crawford, Anthony Scopatz, Kyle Niemer, Zhiu, Delmar Larsen

University and Public Service
=============================

University and public service amount to approximately 10% of my work. As per
advice from the Chair, I did not serve the University in any significant
capacity during the first year. Although, I did meet with all of the HIP
candidates and the ECE LPSOE candidates during their interviews and provided
feedback to the respective search committees.

Workshops
---------

I developed and gave several workshops during the merit period:

- Introduction to Computing with R for the campus Lecturers of Security of
  Employment via the CEE (August 25, 2016)
- Maya Pedal
- SciPy 2016: PyDy
- SciPy 2017: Code generation
- Delta Stewardship Council SWC

Acknowledgements
================

I know this document is supposed to be about my accomplishments but I think it
is important to note the people that contributed to the success of the above
mentioned activities. Case van Dam, the chair, was very supportive of getting
me off on good footing and enabling some of my ideas. The MAE staff has been
superb in their support and help, especially with the MAE Design Studio work.
In particular Felicia Smith, Dave Richardson, Jacob Kitada, Loan-Anh Nguyen,
and Rob Kamisky played important roles. My teaching assistants, Matthew Lefort
and Farhad Ghadamli, were excellent. I couldn't have done any of the extra
classroom innovations without their help and great ideas. I've had two
excellent undergraduate assistants: Vivian Tran and Braden Tinucci. Both
Michael Hill and Steven Velinsky have been especially helpful and attentive
mentors. I also appreciate the dedication and time contributed by all of the
EME |_| 185 project sponsors. And finally, I thank the SymPy and PyDy
development teams.
