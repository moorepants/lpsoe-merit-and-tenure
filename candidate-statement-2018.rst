Introduction
============

My position, Lecturer With Potential Security of Employment, is expected to
demonstrate effectiveness and impact in three primary aspects which are
detailed in the `UCD APM 285`_: *Teaching and Learning*, *Professional
Achievements and Activities*, and *University and Public Service*. For the time
period of **July 1, 2016 to June 30, 2018**, I detail below the activities that
have contributed to each of the above three topics. I have included many
hyperlinks to the results of my work. Please follow them if you have further
interest.

Teaching and Learning
=====================

Teaching and learning constitutes approximately 60% to 70% of my job. Over the
past two years I taught thirteen UCD courses (three of which were new course
preparations for me and one was a complete course redesign): `ENG 122`_
(Introduction to Vibrations) Fall 2016 & 2017, `EME 150A`_ (Mechanical Design)
Fall 2017, two sections of `EME 185A/B`_ (Mechanical Systems Design Project)
Winter-Spring 2017 & 2018, `MAE 223`_ (Multibody Dynamics) Fall 2017, and `MAE
297`_ (Graduate Seminar) Spring 2017. Note that this 6+ course per year
assignment is higher than the recommended 4-5 courses for L(P)SOE's by the
prior vice provost and the Dean of the College of Engineering.

Evidence Backed Educational Practices
-------------------------------------

I have put considerable effort into incorporating research backed educational
practices into my courses as part of my classroom innovations long-term goal.

My goal is to clearly define student learning in each course and focus on
improve student learning. The following lists practices I employ almost
universally across all of my courses:

- utilize learning objective mastery rubric-based assessment,
- use exam reflection surveys,
- increase the amount of in-class active learning and decrease in-class lecture,
- collect weekly feedback from the students and respond to this via extra
  in-class content, extra videos and/or written notes,
- post all notes, videos, assignments, as open access on a comprehensive
  website
- release the vast majority of my teaching materials as open educational
  resources under liberal copyright licenses

EME 150A [Mechanical Design]
----------------------------

I taught this course for the second time with teaching assistant Destiny
Garcia. We made use of the `Unitrans Bike Rack design project`_ I developed the
prior year and added a lesson on lightweight prototyping, detailed in an `EELC
blogpost`_, in addition to the Unitrans maintenance facility visit. The
students gave lightning talks about their group projects and we further
developed a set of rubrics for grading the project memos, reports, and
presentations. This project has been adapted by Prof. Jiancheng Liu at the
University of Pacific Stockton. As a side project, I have mentored two Google
Summer of Code students in the development of a `2D Beam Bending software
package`_ for future computational learning modules for the course.

ENG 122 [Introduction to Mechanical Vibrations]
-----------------------------------------------

I taught this course twice during the period. In the first offering I developed
a weekly one hour in-class computational learning module providing 40 hours of
active learning through live coding and a series of Jupyter_ notebooks. After
the first offering, I developed `a proposal`_ to the UCD Center for Educational
Effectiveness for a grant and was awarded $22k to transform ENG 122 from
lecture-style to one where students learn through in-class computational
thinking exercises. This funding included the creation of an interactive
Jupyter based open access textbook_, a set of computational homework,
developing projects instead of exams, an `educational oriented software
package`_, and the setup of computational cloud infrastructure (JupyterHub_)
for the course and the College of Engineering, and the creation of a training
workshop for this pedagogy approach. Graduate student Kenneth Lyons and I were
funded to do this work. We successfully accomplished these goals and have
presented the work locally and nationally as invited speakers to SacPy, the UCD
College of Education Graduate Group, and at JupyterCon 2018.  Kenneth also
presented `the work`_ for us at SciPy 2018 as an accepted presentation.

As mentioned, this work included the development of a workshop with my Olin
College colleague, Allen Downey, entitled "`Computational Thinking in the
Engineering Curriculum`_", which we delivered for the first time this past
January at UC Davis to about 20 faculty and graduate students at the Data
Science Initiative classroom. Allen also presented a well attended talk
entitled "`Programming as a Way of Thinking`_". We plan to continue to develop
and teach this workshop at coming conferences and it has been adapted for the
Olin Summer Institute.

Since I have begun this work I have been asked by half a dozen professors on
campus to help them with similar instructional needs. For example, Valeria la
Saponara has adopted the Jupyter tool for her composites course. I also applied
to a $3M NSF IUSE grant with Delmar Larsen of the Chemistry department to add
Jupyter to the widely LibreTexts_ project. It was rejected with favorable
reviews and we have plans to resubmit. Lastly, we started a journal entitled
"`The Journal of Open Source Education`_" to allow educators to publish similar
style materials which has recently started accepting publications.

EME 185A/B [Mechanical Systems Design Project]
----------------------------------------------

Over the past two years of EME 185 I have significantly increased the amount of
time each team gets direct mentorship from myself and the teaching assistants.
I have pushed for more TAs per team (decreased to 7 teams per TA from the
initial 15 teams per TA) and have introduced an increased percentage lead TA
position. During the Spring quarter the twenty-two teams each met with the
instructors for 50 minutes each week (up from 25 minutes in 2016). I believe
this is directly correlated with the students' learning and the resulting
quality of the students' work.

The teaching assistants and I have developed numerous improvements to the
course. Students struggle with a number of practical engineering skills each
year and we've come up with a series of learning modules that help address
these: technical report writing, CAD based finite element analysis, 3D
printing, project management with modern cloud services, an introduction to
micro-controllers. These are in addition to the design process learning modules
which I have converted mostly to active learning pedagogy.

We have developed a 15 page `instructor guide`_ for the course that provides
week-by-week tasks for all of the involved instructors. We have improved the
assessment drastically with a comprehensive set of learning objective mastery
based rubrics for all of the written and oral assignments. These have been
utilized for Canvas based ABET assessments with support from Jennifer Quynn and
Kara Moloney. This past year we introduced Canvas quizzes for the reading
materials to support the active learning shift.  Lastly, I've enhanced the
student peer evaluation process with a combination of CATME_ and custom
generated reports. In particular, we provide anonymized views of the teams peer
scores four times throughout the course to help quickly identify struggling
teams.

I have also worked to improve the project solicitation to gain new industry
partners and to strengthen continued relationships with established partners.
We have relationships with Micro-Vu, Buffalo Bicycles, LightRiver Tech,
Chalmers University of Technology, UCD Facilities, EksoBionics, Hegemony Tech,
UCD ARC, WasteBusters, Wetlands Work, Western Cooling Efficiency Center, UCD
Med Center, UCD Vet Med, Seeley International's Integrated Comfort, Felt
Bicycles, Nike Research Lab, ICUEMOTION, Sandia National Labs, InSciTech, LLNL,
Dillon Engineering, Hill Engineering, and more. I have improved the
professional presentation of the solicitation through a custom `proposal
submission website`_ and a curated mailing list of 400+ potential sponsors. I
collect midterm and final feedback via surveys from the sponsors. Steve
Velinsky and I have recruited 66 projects over the past two years that provided
approximately $50k of project funding.

After the 2017 course, I went with two students to deploy their water
sanitation project on the Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia, which was funded through
two student awarded Blum Center Grants and a CITRIS Tech for Social Good grant.

Another very exciting element of this course is an exchange and design
competition I have developed with my collaborators Profs. Petros Abraha and
Shigemichi Oshima at Meijo University in Nagoya Japan. Over the past two years
some 20 Japanese students have visited Davis over three trips and participated
in Engineering Week and the design showcase. We have held cultural exchange
lunches and dinners, visited local engineering companies and research labs, and
the students have competed in the final design competition with our students
which has been a huge success. This past year I was awarded a $24k `Global
Affairs Seed Grant`_ and took 12 UCD student to Japan for an unbelievable trip.
We visited Nobel Prize winning research labs, the Toyota factory and musuem,
and all of the students presented their work to over 80 students and faculty in
an international setting.

MAE 223 [Multibody Dynamics]
----------------------------

It is hard to express how much I enjoyed teaching this course. I came out of
each class so excited because I love the material so much. Due to the
simultaneous, self inflicted, heavy load in ENG |_| 122 described above, I
mostly followed the style of the past offerings. But I did swap out most
chalkboard examples with computational examples through live active coding
exercises using a modern alternative to Autolev (the prior software used in
this course) that I co-developed and maintain called PyDy_. This resulted in
about `20 Jupyter notebooks`_ that I plan to turn into a companion interactive
text as the years progress. I developed two new lectures to provide students an
introduction to trajectory optimization of dynamic systems.  Additionally, I
made all of the `lecture videos`_ available on Youtube for public consumption
and already have several hundred views.

MAE 297 [Graduate Seminar]
--------------------------

I had a few goals for my offering of MAE 297: 1) increase the diversity
(industry/academic, gender, age, etc) of the speakers and the topics, 2) bring
as many speakers as possible from outside UCD on the limited budget, and 3)
initiate a method to share the talks with the world. I developed a `course
website`_ to highlight the speaker schedule and biographies. I obtained
permission from most of the speakers to post `their talks`_ publicly to
Youtube.

.. _their talks: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzAwokZEM7asyvMmXP2pOU0s0V6OyRumi

Guest lectures
--------------

I gave guest lectures in EME 1 (Kong) on Bicycle Dynamics and Control, MAE 223
(Eke) on Kane's Method with PyDy, TTP 298A (Kornbluth) on Human Powered
Machines, and scored final poster presentations in ENG 3 (Vander Gheynst).

Mentoring
---------

During this period I mentored 5 graduate students (1 as primary MSc advisor, 2
as an MSc committee member, 1 as a GSR advisor, and 1 as Google Summer of Code
mentor). My primary advisee, Abe McKay, completed `his MSc`_, doing field work
in Kenya funded through a Blum Center Grant and collaborating with the
non-profit World Bicycle Relief. I mentored 5 teaching assistants in the above
described courses. I have also mentored 3 post graduate and 11 undergraduate
researchers on various projects. One of the post graduates, Scott Kresie, wrote
a conference paper and presented at ICSC 2017. Lastly, I mentored two students
teams. The Solar Boat Team took 2nd place at both the 2017 and 2018
competitions, has secured external funding close to $10k, and has grown to a
20+ member, popular team. The Quadriplegic Friendly Tricycle Team raised over
$18k and completed their `tricycle design`_.

Workshops
---------

I developed, taught, and/or facilitated 7 workshops during the review period.
Internally, I co-taught a workshop introducing the programming language R to
campus LPSOEs for the purposes of scholarly teaching and learning research,
developed and taught the computational thinking workshop described above, and
facilitated a workshop by international visitor Carlos Marroquin on the design
of appropriate technology in collaboration with D-Lab. Externally, I developed
and co-taught two workshops at SciPy: `Simulating Robot, Vehicle, Spacecraft,
and Animal Motion with Python`_ and `Automatic Code Generation with SymPy`_,
and co-taught a Software Carpentry workshop for the California Delta
Stewardship Council, Department of Water Resources, and the EPA on "An
Introducing Data Science with R".

Professional Achievements and Activities
========================================

This topic represents 20% to 30% of my work and a variety of activities can
fulfill this, for example: writing textbooks, writing/reviewing pedagogical
focused proposals, research on pedagogy, engineering research in my discipline,
presenting at conferences, participation in professional organizations, etc.

Publications
------------

I am quite happy to have co-authored a paper on version 1.0 of the computer
aided algebra system SymPy, which I have been a core developer of for the past
decade, in PeerJ Computational Sciences. In just over a year we already have
110+ citations and it was named as the top cited paper in all of PeerJ's
publications for 2017. I also published a paper in the Journal of Open Source
Software on a software package I developed that allows a user to solve optimal
control and parameter identification problems with direct collocation. It
describes a method to simply specify the high level mathematical form of the
problem and, once specified, automatic code generation takes care of creating
efficient algorithms in compiled C code to solve the underlying non-linear
programming problem. I published three conference proceedings and also have the
rough draft of an interactive textbook for ENG 122, as mentioned above. Note
that I attempt to strictly publish in Open Access avenues, as an ethical
imperative.

ICSC 2017
---------

The second highlight of the past two years was being the lead organizer and
host of the `2017 International Cycling Safety Conference`_. With Deb Niemeier,
Mont Hubbard, and Susan Handy as co-organizers we brought over 170
international visitors in for the conference. We partnered with the UCD
National Center for Sustainable Transportation, the City of Davis, multiple
bicycle companies, and local advocacy groups to pull it off. This resulted in
over 90 peer reviewed short papers, 60 presentations, 30 posters, and 2
workshops and the best work of the conference will be published in a special
issue of the Journal of Safety Research due out in about a month. Additionally,
the keynotes highlighted a long standing detriment to bicycle safety that is
socially accepted in policy decisions but has not scientific backing to support
it. This resulted in a number of media pieces on the topic (Capitol Public
Radio, Government Technology, etc.).

Grants
------

I or students I mentored were awarded or co-awarded 10 different grants during
this period totaling just over $160k. I was rejected on two $3M large
collaborative grants to the NSF (SI2-SSI and IUSE), but received favorable
reviews and plan to resubmit the proposals. The following lists the awarded

University and Public Service
=============================

University and public service amounts to approximately 10% of my work. This
work can include committee work, leadership, community service, contributions
to student welfare, professional outreach, and communications to the public. I
have played a service roll in several internal initiatives and also extended my
services to the public through talks, interviews, and workshops.

Internal Service
----------------

During the review period I have served on the MAE Undergraduate committee and
on the MAE Website committee. I also worked with Jenny Quynn and Steven
Wiryadinata to develop several ABET assessments for EME 185 for the 2018
review. I created and presented a talk for decision day and was the Master of
Ceremony for the MAE Master's students at the 2018 commencement. I also sadly
had to deal with two deaths this past year. The Quadriplegic Friendly Tricycle
Team's sponsor, Greg Tanner, passed away after a long battle with ALS. I
accompanied four of the team members to Greg's funeral and spent time. And as
you all know, undergraduate Joseph Goodwin, passed away just weeks before
graduation. I worked with a lot of the affected students to put together a
memorial gathering for them and him. I believe this was helpful for the
students' grieving and contributed to their welfare.

External Service
----------------

I also engaged with the public in a number of ways this review period. I spoke
at visit of Laguna High School students organized by Barbara Linke for her NSF
funded course and spoke at the Sacramento Python Users Group (SacPy) about my
educational efforts that utilized the Python programming language. I was
interviewed several times about the ICSC 2017 conference for NPR and other news
outlets. `The Huffington Post`_ and `The New York Times`_ interviewed us about
our work on bicycle dynamics and control. I also arranged tours for around 30
students to TechnipFMC and DMG Mori last spring to further build our
relationships with them. Lastly, the workshops at SciPy 2017, SciPy 2017, and
the workshop for the Delta Stewardship Council, Department of Water Resources,
and the California EPA provided non-academics with modern computational skills.
My extensive contributions to open source software also provide substantial
public benefit.
