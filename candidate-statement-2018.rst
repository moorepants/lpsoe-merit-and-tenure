Introduction
============

My position, Lecturer With Potential Security of Employment, is expected to
demonstrate excellence and impact in three primary aspects which are detailed
in the `UCD APM 285`_: *Teaching and Learning*, *Professional Achievements and
Activities*, and *University and Public Service*. For the time period of **July
1, 2016 to June 30, 2018**, I detail below the activities that have contributed
to each of the above three topics. I am requesting a **1.5X** merit because I
believe I have excelled at two of the three aspects in these ways:

Teaching and Learning
   I have taught 130% more units than has been recommended for the LPSOE
   faculty over the past two years and have went above and beyond to innovate
   in all of the courses I have taught.
Professional Achievements and Activities
   I have published 2 journal articles, 3 conference papers, hosted a very
   successful research conference in my field, and presented my work
   extensively along with carrying enough funding to support 22 students in a
   variety of projects.

.. _UCD APM 285: https://aadocs.ucdavis.edu/policies/apm/ucd-285.pdf

Teaching and Learning
=====================

Teaching and learning constitutes approximately 60% to 70% of my job. Over the
past two years, I taught thirteen UCD courses [#]_ (three of which were new
course preparations while one was a complete course redesign): `ENG 122`_
(Introduction to Vibrations) Fall 2016 & 2017, `EME 150A`_ (Mechanical Design)
Fall 2017, two sections of `EME 185A/B`_ (Mechanical Systems Design Project)
Winter/Spring 2017 & 2018, `MAE 223`_ (Multibody Dynamics) Fall 2017, and `MAE
297`_ (Graduate Seminar) Spring 2017. Note that this 6+ course per year
assignment is higher than the recommended 4-5 courses (i.e. 1.5X research
faculty assignment) for L(P)SOE's by the prior vice provost and the Dean of the
College of Engineering.

.. [#] I taught five additional courses during the appraisal period:
   EME |_| 150A and two sections each of EME |_| 185 A/B.

Evidence Backed Educational Practices
-------------------------------------

I have put considerable effort into incorporating research backed educational
practices into my courses as part of my long-term goal to innovate in the
classroom. I attempt to clearly define student learning in each course and
focus on improving student learning with respect to that definition. The
following lists the teaching practices I employ almost universally across all
of my courses: 1) utilize rubrics designed to assess learning objective
mastery, 2) use exam reflection surveys, 3) increase the amount of in-class
active learning and decrease in-class lecturing, 4) collect (at least) weekly
feedback from the students and respond to this via extra in-class content,
extra videos, and/or written notes, 5) heavy use of Canvas and its various
features for improving learning, 6) post all notes, videos, assignments, etc.
publicly on a comprehensive website, and 7) release the vast majority of my
teaching materials as open educational resources under liberal copyright
licenses.

EME 150A [Mechanical Design]
----------------------------

I taught this course for the second time with teaching assistant Destiny
Garcia. We made use of the `Unitrans bike rack design project`_ I developed the
prior year and added a lesson on lightweight prototyping, detailed in an `EELC
blogpost`_, in addition to the Unitrans maintenance facility visit. The
students gave lightning talks about their group projects and we further
developed a set of rubrics for grading the project memos, reports, and
presentations. This project has been adapted by Prof. Jiancheng Liu at the
University of Pacific, Stockton. As a side project, I have mentored two Google
Summer of Code students in the development of a `2D Beam Bending software
package`_ for future computational learning modules for the course.

.. _2D Beam Bending software package: https://docs.sympy.org/dev/modules/physics/continuum_mechanics/beam_problems.html

ENG 122 [Introduction to Mechanical Vibrations]
-----------------------------------------------

I taught this course twice during the period. In the first offering, I
developed a weekly one hour in-class computational learning module providing 40
hours of active learning through live coding and a series of Jupyter_ notebooks
[#]_. After the first offering, I developed `a proposal`_ to the UCD Center for
Educational Effectiveness and was awarded $22k to transform ENG 122 from
lecture-style to learning through in-class "computational thinking" exercises.
This funding included the creation of an interactive open access textbook_, a
set of computational homeworks, development of a project, an `educational
oriented software package`_, the setup of computational cloud infrastructure
(JupyterHub_) for the course and the College of Engineering, and the creation
of a training workshop for this pedagogy approach.

.. [#] Jupyter is a tool for weaving traditional textbook content with code and
   interactive web-based content.

Graduate student Kenneth Lyons and I were funded by the grant to do this work.
We successfully accomplished these goals and have presented the work locally
and nationally as invited speakers to SacPy [#]_, the UCD College of Education
Graduate Group, and at JupyterCon 2018 [#]_. Kenneth also presented `the work`_
for us at SciPy 2018, the popular conference on scientific and engineering
computing with Python, as an accepted presentation.

.. [#] SacPy is a local industry oriented users group for the Python
   programming language.
.. [#] A new conference series created due to the exponential demand and wide
   adoption of the tool for research, industry, and education.

As mentioned, this work included the development of a workshop with my Olin
College colleague, Allen Downey, entitled "`Computational Thinking in the
Engineering Curriculum`_", which we delivered for the first time this past
January at UC Davis to about 20 faculty and graduate students at the Data
Science Initiative classroom. I also invited Allen to give a well attended talk
entitled "`Programming as a Way of Thinking`_". We plan to continue to develop
and teach this workshop at coming conferences and it has been adapted for the
Olin Summer Institute.

Since I have begun this work I have received requests from half a dozen
professors on campus to assist them with similar instructional needs. For
example, Valeria la Saponara (MAE) has adopted the Jupyter tool for her
composites course. I also applied to a $3M NSF IUSE grant with Delmar Larsen of
the Chemistry department to add Jupyter to the widely used LibreTexts_ project.
Although denied, it received favorable reviews and we have plans to resubmit.
Lastly, I am now a co-editor for a new journal entitled "`The Journal of Open
Source Education`_" which was conceived to allow educators to publish similar
teaching materials as developed in my work.

EME 185A/B [Mechanical Systems Design Project]
----------------------------------------------

Over the past two years, I have significantly increased the amount of time each
team gets direct mentorship from myself and the teaching assistants. I have
pushed for more TAs per team (decreased the ratio of teams to TA from 15 to 7)
and have introduced a lead TA position with an 35% appointment. During the
Spring quarter, 22 teams each met with the instructors for 50 minutes each
week, an increase from 25 minutes in 2016. I believe this change is directly
correlated with the improvements in students' learning and the resulting
quality of the students' work.

The teaching assistants and I have developed numerous improvements to the
course [#]_. Students struggle with a number of practical engineering skills
each year and we've come up with a series of learning modules that help address
these: technical report writing, CAD based finite element analysis, 3D
printing, project management with modern cloud services, and an introduction to
micro-controllers. These are in addition to the design process learning modules
which I have converted mostly to an active learning pedagogy.

.. [#] During the appraisal period I also developed the new MAE Innovative
   Design Studio for our design classes. The studio has been used for EME 150A,
   EME 130A/B, and EME 185A/B for the last three years. I also visited Olin
   College's capstone design day to survey their program methodology.

We have developed a 15 page `instructor guide`_ for the course that provides
week-by-week tasks for all of the involved instructors. We have improved the
assessments with a comprehensive set of learning objective mastery rubrics for
all of the written and oral assignments. These have been utilized for Canvas
based ABET assessments with support from the CoE (Jennifer Quynn) and the CEE
(Kara Moloney). This past year, we introduced Canvas quizzes for the reading
materials to support the active learning shift. Lastly, I've enhanced the
student peer evaluation process with a combination of CATME_ and custom
generated reports. In particular, we provide anonymized views of the teams peer
scores four times throughout the course to help quickly identify struggling
teams. The teams use this information to work on group problems internally and
the instructors use it to deliver target interventions and mediation This
required us to convince the CoE to buy a site wide software license for CATME.

I have also worked to improve the project solicitation to gain new industry
partners and to strengthen continued relationships with established partners.
We have relationships with local, national, and international
sponsors/organizations including: Micro-Vu, Buffalo Bicycles, LightRiver Tech,
Chalmers University of Technology, UCD Facilities, EksoBionics, Hegemony Tech,
UCD ARC, WasteBusters, Wetlands Work, Western Cooling Efficiency Center, UCD
Med Center, UCD Vet Medicine, Seeley International's Integrated Comfort, Felt
Bicycles, Nike Research Lab, ICUEMOTION, Sandia National Labs, InSciTech, LLNL,
Dillon Engineering, Hill Engineering, and more. I have improved the
professional presentation of the solicitation through a custom `proposal
submission website`_ and a curated mailing list of 200+ potential sponsors. I
collect midterm and final feedback via surveys from the sponsors and used these
to improve communication among the sponsors, teams, and instructors. Steve
Velinsky and I have recruited 66 projects over the past two years that provided
approximately $50k of project funding [#]_.

.. [#] During the appraisal period I additionally solicited 45 proposals,
   advised 33 projects, with $52k worth of funded prototypes for
   EME |_| 185A/B.

After the 2017 course, I went with two students to deploy their water
sanitation project on the Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia, which was funded through
two student awarded Blum Center Grants and a CITRIS Tech for Social Good grant.
This work has been featured in the College of Engineering magazine and website.

Another very exciting element of this course is an exchange and design
competition I have developed with my collaborators Profs. Petros Abraha and
Shigemichi Oshima at Meijo University in Nagoya, Japan. Over the past two
years, some 20 Japanese students have visited Davis over three trips and
participated in Engineering Week and the CoE design showcase. We have held
cultural exchange lunches and dinners and visited local engineering companies
and research labs. The highlight of the exchange have been the two final
design competitions between the Meijo and UCD students, which was a huge
success. Due to these efforts, this past year I was awarded a $24k `Global
Affairs Seed Grant`_ and took 12 UCD student to Japan for an unbelievable
educational trip. We visited Nobel Prize winning research labs, the Toyota
factory and museum, and all of the students presented their work to over 80
students and faculty in an international setting, something that is very unique
for undergraduates. The Meijo Engineering Department was an incredible host.
About a dozen of the faculty provided their personal time to us either through
a lab tour or by attending the students' presentations.

MAE 223 [Multibody Dynamics]
----------------------------

It is hard to express how much I enjoyed teaching this course. I came out of
each class so excited because I love the material so much. Due to the
simultaneous, self inflicted, heavy load in ENG |_| 122 described above, I
mostly followed the style of the past offerings. But I did swap out most
chalkboard examples with computational examples through live active coding
exercises using a modern alternative to Autolev (the prior software used in
this course) that I co-developed and maintain called PyDy_. This resulted in
about `20 Jupyter notebooks`_ that I plan to turn into a companion interactive
text as the years progress. I also managed to develop two new lectures to
provide students an introduction to trajectory optimization of dynamic systems.
Lastly, I made all of the `lecture videos`_ available on YouTube for public
consumption and already have over a hundred views.

MAE 297 [Graduate Seminar]
--------------------------

The goals for my offering of MAE 297 were: 1) increase the diversity
(industry/academic, gender, age, etc.) of the speakers and the topics, 2) bring
as many speakers as possible from outside UCD on the limited budget, and 3)
initiate a method to share the talks with the world. The speaker schedule,
biographies, and videos can be viewed on the `course website`_. Most of the
`speakers' talks`_ were posted publicly to YouTube and one of the speakers,
Prof. Devin Berg, adopted the format with the website and videos for his new
seminar series at the University of Wisconsin-Stout.

Guest lectures, mentoring, and workshops
----------------------------------------

I gave guest lectures in EME |_| 1 (Kong) on Bicycle Dynamics, MAE |_| 223
(Eke) on Kane's Method with PyDy, TTP |_| 298A (Kornbluth) on Human Powered
Machines, and scored poster presentations in ENG 3 (Vander Gheynst).

.. [#] Additional guest lectures during the appraisal period: Prof. |_| Eke's
   2016 multibody dynamics graduate course (MAE |_| 223), Prof. Lin's 2016
   computer science senior design course (ECS |_| 193), Dr. |_| Kornbluth's
   2016 design for development course (TTP |_| 298A)

During this period I mentored 5 graduate students (1 as primary MSc advisor, 2
as an MSc committee member, 1 as a GSR advisor, and 1 as Google Summer of Code
mentor). My primary advisee, Abe McKay, completed `his MSc`_, doing field work
in Kenya funded through a Blum Center Grant and collaborating with the
non-profit World Bicycle Relief. I mentored 5 teaching assistants in the above
described courses. I have also mentored 3 post graduate and 11 undergraduate
[#]_ researchers on various projects. One of the post graduates, Scott Kresie,
wrote a conference paper and presented at ICSC 2017. Lastly, I mentored two
extracurricular student teams. The Solar Boat Team took 2nd place at both the
2017 and 2018 competitions, has secured external funding close to $10k, and has
grown to a 20+ member, popular team. The Quadriplegic Friendly Tricycle Team
raised over $18k and completed their `tricycle design`_. Both of these teams
have supported projects for EME 185.

.. [#] I mentored 3 additional undergraduates during the appraisal period: 1
   UCD and 2 GSoC.

.. _tricycle design: https://objects-us-east-1.dream.io/mechmotum/quad-friendly-trike.png

I developed, taught, and/or facilitated 7 workshops during the review period
[#]_. Internally, I co-taught a `workshop introducing the programming language
R`_ to campus LPSOEs for the purposes of scholarly teaching and learning
research, developed and taught the computational thinking workshop described
above, and facilitated a workshop by international visitor Carlos Marroquin
(Guatemala) on the design of appropriate technology in collaboration with the
UC Davis D-Lab. Externally, I developed and co-taught two workshops at SciPy:
`Simulating Robot, Vehicle, Spacecraft, and Animal Motion with Python`_ and
`Automatic Code Generation with SymPy`_, and co-taught a `Software Carpentry
workshop`_ for the California Delta Stewardship Council, Department of Water
Resources, and the EPA on "An Introducing Data Science with R".

Professional Achievements and Activities
========================================

This topic represents 20% to 30% of my work and a variety of activities can
fulfill this, for example: writing textbooks, writing/reviewing pedagogical
focused proposals, research on pedagogy, engineering research in my discipline,
presenting at conferences, participation in professional organizations, etc.

Publications
------------

I am quite happy to have co-authored a paper on version 1.0 of the computer
aided algebra system SymPy_, which I have been a core developer of for the past
decade, in PeerJ Computational Sciences. In just over a year we already have
110+ citations and it was named as the top cited paper in all of PeerJ's
publications for 2017. I make use of this software package for teaching in both
ENG |_| 122 and MAE |_| 223 as well as research. I also published a paper in
the Journal of Open Source Software on a software package I developed that
allows a user to solve optimal control and parameter identification problems
with direct collocation. I published three conference proceedings papers and
also have the rough draft of an interactive textbook for ENG 122, as mentioned
above. Note that I attempt to strictly publish in Open Access venues, as an
ethical imperative.

.. _SymPy: http://sympy.org

ICSC 2017
---------

The second highlight of the past two years was being the lead organizer and
host of the `2017 International Cycling Safety Conference`_, an annual
specialized conference that brings together cross disciplinary researchers from
engineering, urban planning, policy, and transportation studies to discuss
bicycling safety. Davis, CA was chosen by the steering committee to host the
first offering outside of Europe. With Deb Niemeier (Civil and Environmental
Engineering), Mont Hubbard (Mech. and Aero. Engineering), and Susan Handy
(Environmental Science and Policy) as co-organizers we brought over 170
national and international visitors in for the conference. We partnered with
the UCD National Center for Sustainable Transportation, the City of Davis,
multiple bicycle companies, and local advocacy groups. This resulted in over
`90 peer reviewed short papers`_, 60 presentations, 30 posters, and 2 workshops
and the best work of the conference will be published in a special issue of the
Journal of Safety Research.

University and Public Service
=============================

University and public service amounts to approximately 10% of my work. This
work can include committee work, leadership, community service, contributions
to student welfare, professional outreach, and communications to the public. I
have played a service role in several internal initiatives and also extended my
services to the public through talks, interviews, and workshops.

Internal Service
----------------

During the review period I have served on the MAE Undergraduate committee and
on the MAE Website committee. I also worked with Jenny Quynn (CoE), Ben Shaw
(MAE), and Steven Wiryadinata (MAE) to develop several ABET assessments for EME
185 for the 2018 review. I created and presented a talk for decision day and
was the Master of Ceremony for the MAE Master's students at the 2018
commencement. I also sadly had to deal with two deaths this past year. The
Quadriplegic Friendly Tricycle Team's sponsor, Greg Tanner, passed away after a
long battle with ALS. I accompanied four of the team members to Greg's funeral
and supported the students on hearing the news. As you are all aware,
undergraduate Joseph Goodwin, passed away just weeks before graduation. I
worked with many of the students who were affected by this tragic event to
organize a memorial gathering for Joseph. I believe this emotional support was
helpful for the students' grieving and contributed to their welfare. Many of
the students have thanked me for leading this.

External Service
----------------

I also engaged with the public in a number of ways this review period [#]_. I
spoke to a visiting group of Laguna High School Students organized by Barbara
Linke for her NSF funded course and spoke at the Sacramento Python Users Group
(SacPy) about my educational efforts that utilized the Python programming
language. I was interviewed several times about the ICSC 2017 conference for
NPR and other news outlets. `The Huffington Post`_ and `The New York Times`_
interviewed my collaborators and me about our work on bicycle dynamics and
control. I also arranged tours for around 30 students to TechnipFMC and DMG
Mori last spring to further build our relationships with them. Lastly, the
workshops at SciPy 2017, SciPy 2017, and the workshop for the Delta Stewardship
Council, Department of Water Resources, and the California EPA provided
non-academics with modern computational skills. My extensive contributions to
open source software, particularly with the SymPy and PyDy projects, also
provide substantial public benefit.

   the EELC.

Acknowledgements
================

I know this document is supposed to be about my accomplishments but I think it
is important to note the people that contributed to the success of the above
