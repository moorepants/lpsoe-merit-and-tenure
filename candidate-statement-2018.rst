Introduction
============

Formally, my position, Lecturer With Potential Security of Employment, is
expected to demonstrate effectiveness and impact at meeting the above goals as
assessed by three primary aspects which are detailed in the `UCD APM 285`_:
*Teaching and Learning*, *Professional Achievements and Activities*, and
*University and Public Service*. For the time period of **July 1, 2016 to June
30, 2018**\ [#]_, I detail below the activities that have contributed to each
of the above three topics. I have included hyperlinks to the results of my
work. Please follow them if you have further interest.

Teaching and Learning
=====================

Teaching and learning constitutes approximately 60% to 70% of my job. Over the
past two years I taught thirteen UCD courses (three of which were new to me
course preparations and one was a complete course redesign): `ENG 122`_
(Introduction to Vibrations) Fall 2016 & 2017, `EME 150A`_ (Mechanical Design)
Fall 2017, two sections of `EME 185A/B`_ (Mechanical Systems Design Project)
Winter-Spring 2017 & 2018, `MAE 223`_ (Multibody Dynamics) Fall 2017, and `MAE
297`_ (Graduate Seminar) Spring 2017. Note that this 6 course per year
assignment is higher than the recommended 4-5 courses for L(P)SOE's by the
prior vice provost and the Dean of the College of Engineering.

Evidence Based Educational Practices
------------------------------------

I have put considerable effort into incorporating evidenced backed educational
practices, moving towards active learning, and modernizing the materials as
part of my classroom innovations long-term goal. I strive to incorporate
teaching practices that have strong evidence of improving student learning. The
following lists practices I employ across all of my courses:

- utilize learning objective mastery rubric-based assessment,
- use exam reflection surveys,
- increase the amount of in-class active learning and decrease in-class lecture,
- collect weekly feedback from the students and respond to this via extra
  in-class content, extra videos and/or written notes,
- post all notes, videos, assignments, as open access on a comprehensive
  website
- release the vast majority of my teaching materials as open educational
  resources under liberal copyright licenses

EME 150A [Mechanical Design]
----------------------------

I taught this course for the second time with teaching assistant Destiny
Garcia. We made use of the Unitrans Bike Rack design project I developed the
prior year and added a lesson on lightweight prototyping, detailed in an `EELC
blogpost`_, in addition to the Unitrans maintenance facility visit. The
students gave lightning talks about their projects and we further developed a
set of rubrics for grading the project memos, reports, and presentations. This
project has been used by Prof. Jiancheng Liu at the University of Pacific
Stockton. As an aside, I have mentored two Google Summer of Code students in
the development of a `2D Beam Bending software package`_ for future
computational learning modules for the course.

ENG 122 [Introduction to Mechanical Vibrations]
-----------------------------------------------

I taught this course twice during the period. In the first offering I developed
a weekly one hour in-class computational learning module, introducing 40 hours
of active learning based on live coding and a series of Jupyter_ notebooks.
After the first offering, I developed `a proposal`_ to the UCD Center for
Educational Effectiveness for a grant and was awarded $22k to transform ENG 122
from lecture to active computational learning. This funding included the
creation of an interactive Jupyter based open access textbook_, a set of
computational homework, developing projects instead of exams, and the setup of
computational cloud infrastructure for the course and the College of
Engineering. Kenneth Lyons and I were funded to do this work. We successfully
accomplished these goals and have presented the work locally and nationally as
invited speakers to SacPy, the UCD College of Education Graduate Group,and
JupyterCon 2018. Kenneth also presented `the work`_ for us at SciPy 2018.

This work led into the development of a workshop with my Olin College
colleague, Allen Downey, entitled "`Computational Thinking in the Engineering
Curriculum`_", which we delivered for the first time this past January at UC
Davis to about 20 faculty and graduate students at the Data Science Initiative
classroom. Allen also presented a well attended talk entitled "`Programming as
a Way of Thinking`_". We plan to continue to develop and teach this workshop.

Since I have begun this work I have been asked by half a dozen professors on
campus to help them with similar instructional needs. For example, Valeria la
Saponara has adopted the Jupyter tool for her composites course. I also applied
to a $3M NSF IUSE grant with Delmar Larsen of the Chemistry department to add
Jupyter to the widely LibreTexts_ project. It was rejected with favorable
reviews and we have plans to resubmit.

EME 185A/B [Mechanical Systems Design Project]
----------------------------------------------

Over the past two years of EME 185 I have significantly increased the amount of
time each team gets direct mentorship from myself and the teaching assistants.
I have pushed for more TAs per team (decreased to 7 teams per TA from the
initial 15 teams per TA) and have introduced an increased percentage lead TA
position. During the Spring quarter the twenty-two teams each met with the
instructors for 50 minutes each week (up from 25 minutes in 2016). I believe
this is directly correlated with the students learning and the resulting
quality of the students' work.

The teaching assistants and I have developed numerous improvements to the
course. Students struggle with a number of practical engineering skills each
year and we've come up with a series of learning modules that help address
these: technical report writing, CAD based finite element analysis, 3D
printing, project management with modern cloud services, an introduction to
micro-controllers. These are in addition to the design process learning modules
which I have converted to mostly active learning pedagogy.

We have developed a 15 page `instructor guide`_ for the course that provides
week-by-week tasks for all of the involved instructors. We have improved the
assessment drastically with a comprehensive set of learning objective mastery
based rubrics for all of the written and oral assignments. These have been
utilized for Canvas based ABET assessments. This past year we introduced Canvas
quizzes for the reading materials to support the active learning shift.
Lastly, I've enhanced the student peer evaluation process with a combination of
CATME_ and custom generated reports. In particular, we provide anonymized views
of the teams peer scores four times throughout the course to help quickly
identify struggling teams.

I have also worked to improve the project solicitation to gain new industry
partners and to strengthen continued relationships with established partners.
We have strong relationships with Micro-Vu, Buffalo Bicycles, LightRiver
Technologies, UCD Med Center, UCD Vet Med, Seeley International's Integrated
Comfort, etc. I have improved the professional presentation of the solicitation
through a custom `proposal submission website`_ and a curated mailing list of
400+ potential sponsors. Steve Velinsky and I have recruited 66 projects over
the past two years that provided approximately $Xk of project funding. X were
industry, X were non-profit, X were TODO

After the 2017 course, I went with two students to deploy their water
sanitation project on the Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia, which was funded through
two student awarded Blum Center Grants and a CITRIS Tech for Social Good grant.

Another very exciting element of this course is an exchange and design
competition I have developed with my collaborators Profs. Petros Abraha and
Shigemichi Oshima at Meijo University in Nagoya Japan. Over the past two years
some 20 Japanese students have visited Davis over three trips and participated
in Engineering Week and the design showcase. We have held cultural exchange
lunches and dinners, visited local engineering companies and research labs, and
the students have competed in the final design competition with our students
which has been a huge success. This past year I was awarded a $24k `Global
Affairs Seed Grant`_ and took 12 UCD student to Japan for an unbelievable trip.
We visited Nobel Prize winning research labs, the Toyota factory and musuem,
and all of the students presented their work to over 80 students and faculty.

MAE 223 [Multibody Dynamics]
----------------------------

I cannot express how much I enjoyed teaching this course. I came out of each
class so excited because I love the material so much. Due to the heavy load in
ENG 122 described above, I mostly followed the style of past offerings. But I
did swap out most chalkboard examples with computational examples through live
active coding exercises using a modern alternative to Autolev (the prior
software used in this course) that I co-developed and maintain. This resulted
in about `20 Jupyter notebooks`_ that I plan to turn into a companion
interactive text as the years progress. I developed two new lectures to provide
students an introduction to trajectory optimization of dynamic systems.
Additionally, I made all of the `lecture videos`_ available on Youtube for
public consumption.

MAE 297 [Graduate Seminar]
--------------------------

I had a few goals for my offering of MAE 297: 1) increase the diversity
(industry/academic, gender, age, etc) of the speakers and the topics, 2) bring
as many speakers as possible from outside UCD on the limited budget, and 3)
initiate a method to share the talks with the world. I developed a `course
website`_ to highlight the speaker schedule and biographies. I obtained
permission from most of the speakers to post `their talks`_ publicly to
Youtube.

Guest lectures
--------------

I gave guest lectures in EME 1 (Kong), ECS 198 (Kornbluth), and scored ENG 3
(van der Ghyst) projects.

Mentoring
---------

During this period I mentored six graduate students (1 as primary MSc advisor,
2 as an MSc committee member, 1 as a GSR advisor, and 1 as Google Summer of
Code mentor). My primary advisee, Abe McKay, completed his MSc, doing field
work in Kenya funded through a Blum Center Grant and collaborating with the
non-profit World Bicycle Relief. I mentored 5 teaching assistants in the above
courses. I have also mentored 3 post graduate and 11 undergraduate researchers
on various projects. One of the post-graduates, Scott Kresie, wrote a paper and
presented at ICSC 2017. Lastly, I mentored two students teams. The Solar Boat
Team took 2nd place at both the 2017 and 2018 competitions, has secured
external funding close to $10k, and has grown to a 20+ member, popular team.
The Quadriplegic Friendly Tricycle Team raised over $18k and completed their
tricycle design.

Professional Achievements and Activities
========================================

This topic represents 20% to 30% of my work and a variety of activities can
fulfill this, for example: writing textbooks, writing/reviewing pedagogical
focused proposals, research on pedagogy, engineering research in my discipline,
presenting at conferences, participation in professional organizations, etc.

Publications
------------

I am quite happy to have co-authored a paper on version 1.0 of the computer
aided algebra system SymPy, which I have been a core developer of for the past
decade, in PeerJ Computational Sciences. In just over a year we already have
130+ citations and it was named as the top cited paper in all of PeerJ's
publications for 2017. I also published a paper in the Journal of Open Source
Software on a software package I developed that allows a user to solve optimal
control and parameter identification problems with direct collocation by simply
specifying the high level mathmatrical form of the problem. Once specified,
automatic code generation takes care of creating efficient algorithms in
compiled C code to solve the non-linear programming problem. Note that I
attempt to strictly publish in Open Access avenues, as an ethical imperative. I
also have the draft of an interactive textbook for ENG 122, as mentioned above.

ICSC 2017
---------

The second highlight of the past two years was being the lead organizer and
host of the 2017 International Cycling Safety Conference. With Deb Neimer, Mont
Hubbard, and Susan Handy as co-organizers we brought over 170 international
visitors in for the conference. We partnered with the UCD National Center for
Sustainable Transportation, the City of Davis, multiple bicycle companies, and
local advocacy groups to pull it off. This resulted in over 90 peer reviewed
short papers, 60 presentations, 30 posters, and 2 workshops and the best work
of the conference will be published in a special issue of the Journal of
Somethinganother. Additionally, the keynotes highlighted a long standing
detriment to bicycle safety that is socially accepted in policy decisions but
has not scientific backing to support it. This resulted in a number of media
pieces on the topic in NPR, etc, and etc.

Conferences
-----------

I attended multiple confernces: BMD 2016, SciPy 2017, ICSC 2017, SOTL 2017 &
2018.

Grants
------

I was or students I mentored were awarded 10 different grants during this
period. I was rejected on two $3M large collaborative grants to the NSF, but
received favorable reviews and the proposals will be resubmitted.

I was co-granted funds as a mentoring organization totalling $64k from Google
Summer of Code to support nine undergraduate students through SymPy_ and the
Python Software Foundation for the summer of 2016. I mentored two students in
2015 and two students in 2016 through this program. I also play a lead
developer role in the open source software packages SymPy_ and PyDy_ which have

I have developed collaborations over the past two years with Allen Downey,
Andrew Hall (World Bicycle Relief), Paul Crawford (Hegemony Technologies),
Anthony Scopatz (University of South Carolina), Kyle Niemer (Oregon State),
Zhiu, Delmar Larsen

University and Public Service
=============================

University and public service amounts to approximately 10% of my work. I have
played a service roll in several internal initiatives and also extended my
pro-bono services to the public through talks, interviews, and workshops.

Internal Service
----------------

During the review period I have served on the MAE Undergraduate committee and
on the MAE Website committee. I also worked with Jenny Quynn and Steven Win....
to develop several ABET assessments for EME 185 for the 2018 review. I created
and presented a talk for decision day and was the Master of Ceremony for the
MAE Master's students at the 2018 commencement. I also sadly had to deal with
two deaths this past year. The Quadriplegic Friendly Tricycle Team's sponsor,
Greg Tanner, passed away after a long battle with ALS. I accompanied four of
the team members to Greg's funeral and spent time. And as you all know,
undergraduate Joseph Goodwin, passed away just weeks before graduation. I
worked with a lot of the affected students to put together a memorial gathering
for them and him. I believe this was helpful for the students' grieving and
contributed to their welfare.

External Service
----------------

I also engaged with the public in a number of ways this review period. I spoke
at visit of Laguna High School students organized by Barbara Linke for her NSF
funded course and spoke at the Sacramento Python Users Group (SacPy) about my
educational efforts that utlized the Python programming language. I was
interviewed several times about the ICSC 2017 confrence for NPR and other news
outlets. The Huffiginton Post and the The New York Times interviewed us about
our work on bicycle dynamics and control. I also arranged tours for around 30
students to Technip FMC and DMG Mori last spring to further build our
relationships with them. Lastly, the workshops at SciPy 2017, SciPy 2017, and
the workshop for the Delta Stewardship Council, Department of Water Resrouces,
and the California EPA provided non-academics with modern computational skills.

Acknowledgements
================

I know this document is supposed to be about my accomplishments but I think it
is important to note the people that contributed to the success of the above
mentioned activities. Thanks to my amazing 22 mentees.


Case van Dam, the chair, was very supportive of getting
me off on good footing and enabling some of my ideas. The MAE staff has been
superb in their support and help, especially with the MAE Design Studio work.
In particular Felicia Smith, Dave Richardson, Jacob Kitada, Loan-Anh Nguyen,
and Rob Kamisky played important roles. My teaching assistants, Matthew Lefort
and Farhad Ghadamli, were excellent. I couldn't have done any of the extra
classroom innovations without their help and great ideas. I've had two
excellent undergraduate assistants: Vivian Tran and Braden Tinucci. Both
Michael Hill and Steven Velinsky have been especially helpful and attentive
mentors. I also appreciate the dedication and time contributed by all of the
EME |_| 185 project sponsors. And finally, I thank the SymPy and PyDy
