Introduction
============

My primary goal in my capacity as a teaching faculty in the Mechanical
Engineering department is to facilitate the most fulfilling, rich, and
empowering experience for as many of our students that I can, both in and out
of the department. In particular, I want to foster the joy of engineering and
learning, intrinsically motivated student **led** learning, and inclusive
multidisciplinary approaches to solving problems.

To achieve this goal, my academic role is centered around undergraduate
education in our department. I teach between four and six courses per academic
year, develop our capability for and success in engineering education, serve
the university in educational related needs, and represent the university and
myself in a professionally domestically and internationally.

My long term goals span from my classroom to other's. These goals can be
categorized in terms of their broadness of impact:

Classroom innovations
   For the classes I teach and am involved with I will continuously develop new
   methods to improve student learning. These methods will be based on research
   backed evidence and my own assessments, thus requiring continuous
   experimentation.
Department wide
   At the department level, I hope to share my classroom innovations with
   fellow faculty members and provide assistance on parallel and synergistic
   activities.  Additionally, I want to facilitate stronger collaborations
   among faculty that teach the same courses [why?]. Lastly, [still working on this 2021] I hope to lead department
   wide initiatives to improve our curriculum and provide studentss with a wider set of practical skills as they enter the workforce. .through broader implementation of
   changes to classes (that will enhance students' set of practical skills . For example, I have interests in developing a cohesive
   design experience that permeates each year in the curriculum, which will
   build intrinsic motivation and the practical engineering skills employers
   need [whoa hard to read and super fluffy?]. I also would like to play a role in introducing computational learning
   throughout our curriculum to ensure each of students learns modern
   computational skills for today's job market and academic research.
College wide
   There are a number of opportunities to develop engineering curricula that
   crosses department boundaries. For example, the senior design courses could
   be greatly enhanced for students and participating companies by offering
   multidisciplinary design projects that are solved by teams of engineers from each
   department.
University Wide
   University wide, I hope to build more connections around open access
   textbooks, computational and data science efforts, in particular for
   education researchers, and bringing engineering in to solve international
   development problems.
National and International
   My external work will focus on the development of interactive modular open
   texts for engineering subjects, widely sharing my and our departments
   leadership in modernizing engineering education.

Formally, my position, Lecturer With Potential Security of Employment, is
expected to demonstrate effectiveness and impact at meeting the above goals as
assessed by three primary aspects which are detailed in the `UCD APM 285`_:
*Teaching and Learning*, *Professional Achievements and Activities*, and
*University and Public Service*.

.. _UCD APM 285: http://manuals.ucdavis.edu/apm/285.htm

For the time period of July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016 [#]_. I detail below the
activities that have contributed to each of the above three topics. Due to my
activities being different than research faculty, I've included many hyperlinks
to the results of my work. Please follow them if you have further interest.

.. [#]  Note that I officially started on September 21st, 2015 but particpated
        in some activities to prepare for the position in the 2015 summer
        months which are included herein.

Teaching and Learning
=====================

Teaching and learning constitutes approximately 60% to 70% of my job. This year
I taught five courses: `EME 150A`_ (Mechanical Design) in the Fall and two
sections each of `EME 185A/B`_ (Mechanical Systems Design Project) in the
winter and spring quarters, all of which were new course preparations. Between
the course evaluations and extra feedback I collect throughout my classes, I
had, on average, favorable reviews. This year I focused primarily on developing
and enhancing the courses as part of my classroom innovations long-term goal.

.. Not that my course evaulations are poor, but this article provides
   interesting insights on what coruse evaluations may actually mean:

EME 150A [Mechanical Design]
----------------------------

Along with teaching EME150A for the first time, I developed a number of
enhancements for the course. The course is a mixture of applied strength of
materials (static and dynamic failure) and an introduction to the design of
mechanical structures. For the former, I developed lectures influenced by two
previous professors' materials that were enhanced by inserting one to two
active learning mini-activities in most lectures along with quizzes every other
week. The course materials can be viewed at the `class website`_.

.. _class website: http://moorepants.github.io/eme150a/

This was accompanied by `homework problems`_ I developed myself and three pilot
finite element analysis lessons that were developed by my teaching assistant,
which received positive reviews. The students were assessed with two exams, the
first of which a midterm reflection was used to improve preparation for the
final\ [#]_. I introduced a `new design project`_ in partnership with Unitrans
to increase the connections with the followup EME 185 course. The students
worked in teams to develop a conceptual design for a transit bus front mounted
bicycle rack. Teams were selected using CATME_ [#]_, students attended a field
trip to asses a bus and collect client needs at the Unitrans maintenance
facility, students had to process and interpret real data from bus
accelerometer data for dynamic analysis, four memos were used for design
feedback and technical writing improvement, peer reviews of report drafts, and
teammate peer reviews using CATME_. Most of the tools and methods I employed
are backed by evidence based education research and are summarized in detail in
my `blog post`_ about the class.

EME 185 [Mechanical Systems Design Project]
-------------------------------------------

Starting in the Fall, I worked to develop improvements for the new combined
EME\ 185A/B course which I co-teach with Prof. Steve Velinsky. The course details
can be found on my `EME185 course website`_. I enhanced the Fall quarter project
solicitation and connections with companies, non-profits, and research
institutes by tapping into the Career and Internship Center, the CTSC
collaboration with Biomedical Engineering, and the CoE corporate relations
office with a improved `online presence`_ and personal solicitation that
generated approximately `45 proposals`_.  Of the 45, 33 projects were
ultimately selected for my sections, which I oversaw for the two quarters. This
included companies and organizations such as NIKE, Micro-Vu, Schilling
Robotics, LLNL, InSciTech, UCD WCEC, Felt Bicycles, Sandia National Labs,
ICUEMOTION, etc.

.. _45 proposals: http://moorepants.github.io/eme185/pages/projects.html

The students greatly appreciated the fact that they were able to be matched to
a project they were passionate about. I use a custom algorithm that uses survey
data and students' project preferences to form teams, Ã  la CATME_, which I plan
to develop into a tool to share with the education community. The participating
organizations funded approximately $45k for prototype development with about
$7k raised for general course use.

During the course, we utilized the new `MAE Innovative Design Studio`_ that I
created for running new design ideation, selection, and planning activities
which is the initial stage of moving to an activity based course as opposed to
a lecture based one. Additionally, my TA and I introduced a new two part
Arduino-based `microcontroller lesson`_ to introduce students to sensing,
computing, actuation, and control for enhanced mechanical designs. The result
was that a large percentage of projects included microcontrollers in their
design. We also included a popular lecture on 3D printing led by three guest
graduate students and a young engineers industry panel. The students were
assessed through five memos, four reports, two design reviews, and two
presentations. I developed a comprehensive set of rubrics for assessment to
track the improvement in technical communication over the two courses for each
of these items.

Lastly, this year was the first year of an international exchange with
mechanical design students at Meijo University in Nagoya, Japan. Ten students
and two professors visited UCD and participated in our design reviews, gave
presentations on their design projects, led an interactive cultural exchange
with our students, participated in Engineering Week activities, and enjoyed
local tourism.

Other
-----

In addition to my primary teaching duties, I developed and gave guest lectures
in Prof.\ Eke's multibody dynamics graduate course (MAE\ 223), Prof. Lin's
computer science Senior design course (ECS\ 193), and Dr\. Kornbluth's design
for development course (TTP\ 298A).

Outside of teaching courses, I led and participated in a number teaching and
learning activities. I led the collaborative effort the development of the `MAE
Innovative Design Studio`_ to provide an project based active learning space
for our project and design classes (EME 150A, EAE 130, EME 185, etc). I
introduced a new competition team, the `California Solar Regatta`_, where our
students came in 2nd in design for their first showing. I mentored and traveled
with three of my students who received $6k from the Blum Center in internal
grants to implement their `senior design project in Cambodia`_ with a local
NGO, Wetlands Work! I mentored one student under a 199 course in the
preliminary design of an electric tricycle for an ALS patient that was awarded
a $3.5k CITRIS grant and a $15k tricycle donation from Outrider USA. This
project led into an early start collaborative senior design project between BME
and MAE with nine students which I mentored throughout the summer. I
participated in the Engineering Education Learning Community and created and
ran The Hacker Within with the Data Science Institute which reached about 75
graduate students.

Outside of the university, I was able to visit Olin College in September for
their SCOPE_ [4]_ day and learn about their innovative senior design program
among many other aspects of their engineering educations methods. I taught a
two-day `Software Carpentry Workshop`_ at iHub in Nairobi, Kenya in June. I
mentored two Google Summer of Code students that developed SymPy modules for 2D
beam bending (EME 150A enhancement) and O(N) multibody dynamics methods (MAE
223 enhancement).

Professional Achievements and Activities
========================================

This topic represents 20% to 30% of my work and a variety of activities can
fulfill this, for example: writing textbooks, writing/reviewing pedagogical
focused proposals, research on pedagogy, engineering research in my discipline,
presenting at conferences, participation in professional organizations, etc.

This past year, I attended two conferences and developed a presentation for an
additional one that was presented for me. At the 2015 First Year Engineering
Education conference I attended talks from leaders in engineering education and
networked to get familiar with my new career path. At `SciPy 2015`_ I gave `a
talk`_ on trajectory optimization and system identification with direct
collocation of biomechanical systems and `a half day workshop`_ on multibody
dynamics and control with Python. Additionally, I acted as a reviewer for the
submissions at SciPy.

I became an editor of `The Journal of Open Engineering`_ and reviewed papers
for both the Journal of Sports Science and Advances in Mechanical Engineering.
I served on the `2016 Bicycle and Motorcycle Dynamics Conference`_ organizing
committee as the Publishing Chair where I managed `the proceedings`_ and also
on the scientific committee where I reviewed paper submissions.

I was co-granted awards totalling $64k from Google Summer of Code to support
nine undergraduate students through SymPy_ and the Python Software Foundation.
I mentored two students in 2015 and two students in 2016 through this program.
I also play a lead developer role in the open source software packages SymPy_
and PyDy_ which have thousands of users worldwide. I co-authored an `in-press
paper`_ this year about this package and its impact to science.

University and Public Service
=============================

University and public service amount to approximately 10% of my work. As per
advice from the Chair, I did not serve the University in any significant
capacity during the first year. Although, I did meet with all of the HIP
candidates and the ECE LPSOE candidates during their interviews and provided
feedback to the respective search committees.

As for public service, I was interviewed by Nature for an `article on bicycle
dynamics`_. Additionally, I maintain a blog_ with scholarly posts and social
media accounts where I post engineering and scholarly materials.

Acknowledgements
================

I know this document is supposed to be about my accomplishments but I think it
is important to note the people that contributed to the success of the above
mentioned activities. The MAE staff has been superb in their support and help,
especially with the MAE Design Studio work. My TAs for the first year were
excellent. I couldn't have done any of the extra classroom innovations without
their help and great ideas. I've had two excellent undergraduate assistants:
Brennan Someting and Vivian Tran. My external colleagues.
