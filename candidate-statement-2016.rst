Introduction
============

My primary goal in my capacity as a teaching faculty in the Mechanical
Engineering department is to facilitate the most fulfilling, rich, and
empowering experience for as many of our students that I can, both in and
outside of the department. In particular, I want to foster the joy of
engineering and learning, intrinsically motivated student **led** learning, and
inclusive multidisciplinary approaches to solving problems.

More specifically, my long term goals span from my classroom to the wider
university setting and beyond. These goals can be categorized in terms of their
broadness of impact:

Classroom innovations
   For the classes I teach and am involved with, I will continuously develop
   new methods to improve student learning. These methods will be based on
   research backed evidence and my own assessments, thus requiring continuous
   experimentation.
Department wide
   At the department level, I hope to share my classroom innovations with
   fellow faculty members and provide assistance on parallel and synergistic
   activities. Additionally, I want to facilitate stronger collaborations among
   faculty that teach the same courses to provide consistent experiences for
   our students and reduce instructor workload. Lastly, I hope to lead
   department wide initiatives to improve our curriculum through systematic
   changes across multiple courses. For example, I have interests in developing
   a cohesive design experience that permeates each year in the curriculum.
   This can catalyze students' intrinsic motivation to learn and develop the
   practical engineering skills employers need. I also would like to play a
   role in introducing computational learning throughout our curriculum to
   ensure each of our students acquires modern computational skills relevant
   for today's job market and academic research.
College wide
   There are a number of opportunities to develop engineering curricula that
   cross department boundaries. For example, we could offer multidisciplinary
   design projects that are solved by teams of engineers from different
   departments that can greatly enhance the senior design courses for both the
   students and participating company sponsors/mentors.
University wide
   I would like to build connections beyond the College of Engineering where
   open access textbooks (e.g. UCD LibreTexts), scientific computing,
   multi-disciplinary design projects, and data science provide the common
   links.
National and international
   My external work will focus on the development of interactive modular open
   texts and teaching materials for engineering subjects, widely sharing my and
   our department's leadership in modernizing engineering education to the
   engineering education community. I also plan to conduct some domain specific
   research and consulting to maintain my engineering proficiency and provide
   materials for the classroom.

To achieve these goals, my academic role is centered around undergraduate
education in our department. I teach between four and six courses per academic
year, develop our capability for and success in engineering education, serve
the university in educational related needs, and represent the university and
myself at a professional level both domestically and internationally.

Formally, my position, Lecturer With Potential Security of Employment, is
expected to demonstrate effectiveness and impact at meeting the above goals as
assessed by three primary aspects which are detailed in the `UCD APM 285`_:
*Teaching and Learning*, *Professional Achievements and Activities*, and
*University and Public Service*. For the time period of July 1, 2015 to June
30, 2016 [#]_, I detail below the activities that have contributed to each of
the above three topics. As some of these actions differ from that of research
faculty, I have included hyperlinks to the results of my work. Please follow
them if you have further interest.

.. [#]  Note that I officially started on September 21st, 2015 but particpated
        in some activities to prepare for the position in the 2015 summer
        months which are included herein.

Teaching and Learning
=====================

Teaching and learning constitutes approximately 60% to 70% of my job. This year
I taught five courses, all of which were new course preparations: `EME 150A`_
(Mechanical Design) in the fall and two sections each of `EME 185A/B`_
(Mechanical Systems Design Project) in the winter and spring quarters. Between
the course evaluations and extra feedback I collected throughout my classes, I
had, on average, favorable reviews. This year, I focused primarily on
developing and enhancing these courses as part of my classroom innovations
long-term goal.

.. Not that my course evaulations are poor, but this article provides
   interesting insights on what coruse evaluations may actually mean:

EME 150A [Mechanical Design]
----------------------------

Along with teaching EME |_| 150A for the first time, I developed a number of
enhancements for the course. The course is a mixture of applied strength of
materials (static and dynamic failure) and an introduction to the design of
mechanical structures. Lectures I developed were influenced by two previous
professors' materials and enhanced by inserting one to two active learning
mini-activities along with quizzes every other week. The course materials can
be viewed on the `course website`_.

.. _course website: http://moorepants.github.io/eme150a/

These activities were accompanied by `homework problems`_ I developed myself
and three pilot finite element analysis lessons that were created by my
teaching assistant, the latter of which received very positive reviews. The
students were assessed with two exams where the first employed a self
reflection component to improve preparation for the final\ [#]_. I introduced a
`new design project`_ in partnership with Unitrans to increase the connections
with the followup EME |_| 185 course. The students worked in teams, which were
selected using a program called CATME_\ [#]_, to develop a conceptual design
for a transit bus front mounted bicycle rack. Students visited the Unitrans
maintanence facility to asses a bus and collect client needs and had to process
and interpret real data from bus accelerometer data for dynamic analysis. Four
memos were assigned for design feedback and technical writing improvement in
addition to peer reviews of report drafts, while teammate peer reviews were
conducted using CATME_. Most of the tools and methods I employed are backed by
evidence based education research and are summarized in detail in my `blog
post`_ about the class.

   that accounts for many things such as gender, motivation, and schedules
   and for conducting peer reviews that is backed by research in team work (see

EME 185 [Mechanical Systems Design Project]
-------------------------------------------

Starting in the fall, I worked to develop improvements for the new combined EME
|_| 185A/B course which I co-teach with Prof. Steve Velinsky. The course
details can be found on my `EME185 course website`_. I enhanced the fall
quarter project solicitation and connections with companies, non-profits, and
research institutes by tapping into the Internship and Career Center, the CTSC
collaboration with Biomedical Engineering, and the CoE corporate relations
office with a improved `online presence`_ and personal solicitation that
generated approximately `45 proposals`_.  Of the 45, 33 projects were
ultimately selected for my sections, which I oversaw for the two quarters. This
included companies and organizations such as NIKE, Micro-Vu, Schilling
Robotics, LLNL, InSciTech, UCD WCEC, Felt Bicycles, Sandia National Labs,
ICUEMOTION, etc. the participating organizations funded approximately $52k for
prototype development.

.. _EME185 course website: http://moorepants.github.io/eme185/
.. _45 proposals: http://moorepants.github.io/eme185/pages/projects.html

When assigning students to projects, I created a custom algorithm that uses
survey data and students' project preferences to form teams, à la CATME_, which
I plan to develop into a tool to share with the education community. The
majority of the teams worked very well together and students greatly
appreciated being matched to a project they were passionate about.

During the course, we utilized the new `MAE Innovative Design Studio`_\ [#]_
that I created for running new design ideation, selection, and planning
activities which is the initial stage of moving to an activity based course as
opposed to a lecture based one. Additionally, my TA and I introduced a new
two-part Arduino-based `microcontroller lesson`_ to introduce students to
sensing, computing, actuation, and control for enhanced mechanical designs.
This additional lesson proved fruitful and the result was that a large
percentage of projects included microcontrollers in their design. We also
included popular lectures on 3D printing led by three guest graduate students
and a young engineers industry panel. The students were assessed through five
memos, four reports, two design reviews, two presentations, and three peer
reviews, the latter taken through CATME_. I developed a comprehensive set of
rubrics for assessment to track the improvement in technical communication over
the two courses for each of these items that tie into writing outcome
improvements in other MAE courses.

.. [#] See the next section for more details about the design studio.

Lastly, this year was the first year of an international exchange with
mechanical design students at Meijo University in Nagoya, Japan that I
coordinated. Ten students and two professors visited UCD and participated in
our design reviews, gave presentations on their design projects, led an
interactive cultural exchange with our students, participated in Engineering
Week activities, and enjoyed local tourism. The student feedback indicated that
this was a very enriching experience, doubly so for the visiting students.

Other
-----

In addition to my primary teaching duties, I developed and gave guest lectures
in Prof. |_| Eke's multibody dynamics graduate course (MAE |_| 223), Prof.
Lin's `computer science senior design course`_ (ECS |_| 193), and Dr. |_|
Kornbluth's design for development course (TTP |_| 298A).

.. _computer science senior design course: http://www.moorepants.info/blog/swc-git-for-cs-undergrads.html

Outside of teaching courses, I led and participated in a number of teaching and
learning activities. I led the collaborative effort of the development of the `MAE
Innovative Design Studio`_ to provide an group oriented active learning space
for our project and design classes (EME |_| 150A, EAE |_| 130, EME |_| 185,
etc). I introduced a new competition team, the `California Solar Regatta`_,
where our students came in 2nd in design for their first showing. I mentored
and planned to travel with three of my students who received $6k from the Blum
Center in internal grants to implement their `senior design project in
Cambodia`_ with a local NGO, Wetlands Work!. I mentored one student under a 199
course in the preliminary design of an electric tricycle for an ALS patient
that was awarded a $3.5k `CITRIS grant`_ and a $15k Outrider USA electric
tricycle donation from an independent donor. This project led into an early
start collaborative senior design project between BME and MAE with nine
students which I mentored throughout the summer. I participated in the
`Engineering Education Learning Community`_ along with other LPSOEs and created
and ran `The Hacker Within`_ with the Data Science Institute which reached
about 75 graduate students over the year. I also created an undergraduate
position titled "Engineering Education Assistant" and hired one student into
this position to help me with educational initiatives.

Outside of the university, I was able to visit Olin College in September for
their SCOPE_ [#]_ day and learn about their innovative senior design program
among many other aspects of their engineering education methods. I taught a
two-day `Software Carpentry Workshop`_ at iHub in Nairobi, Kenya in June. I
mentored two Google Summer of Code students in the summer of 2015 and two in
summer of 2016 that developed SymPy modules for enhancements used in MAE |_|
223 and EME |_| 150A.

Professional Achievements and Activities
========================================

This topic represents 20% to 30% of my work and a variety of activities can
fulfill this, for example: writing textbooks, writing/reviewing pedagogical
focused proposals, research on pedagogy, engineering research in my discipline,
presenting at conferences, participation in professional organizations, etc.

This past year, I attended two conferences and developed a presentation for an
additional one that was presented for me. At the 2015 First Year Engineering
Education conference I attended talks from leaders in engineering education and
networked to get familiar with my new career path. At `SciPy 2015`_ I gave `a
talk`_ on trajectory optimization and system identification with direct
collocation of biomechanical systems and `a half day workshop`_ on multibody
dynamics and control with Python.  Additionally, I acted as a reviewer for the
submissions at SciPy. I developed a talk on the same topic as SciPy for the
International Society of Biomechanics Technical Group on Computer Simulation
conference.

I became an editor of `The Journal of Open Engineering`_ and reviewed papers
for both the Journal of Sports Science and Advances in Mechanical Engineering.
I served on the `2016 Bicycle and Motorcycle Dynamics Conference`_ organizing
committee as the Publishing Chair where I managed `the proceedings`_ and also
on the scientific committee where I reviewed paper submissions. I am
co-organizing the 2017 International Cycling Safety Conference which will be
held at UC Davis with Profs. Deb Niemeier and Mont Hubbard.

I was co-granted funds as a mentoring organization totalling $64k from Google
Summer of Code to support nine undergraduate students through SymPy_ and the
Python Software Foundation for the summer of 2016. I mentored two students in
2015 and two students in 2016 through this program. I also play a lead
developer role in the open source software packages SymPy_ and PyDy_ which have
thousands of users worldwide. I co-authored a `preprint`_ this year
titled "SymPy: Symbolic Computing in Python" about this package and its impact
to science which has been submitted to PeerJ.

University and Public Service
=============================

University and public service amount to approximately 10% of my work. As per
advice from the Chair, I did not serve the University in any significant
capacity during the first year. Although, I did meet with all of the HIP
candidates and the ECE LPSOE candidates during their interviews and provided
feedback to the respective search committees.

As for public service, I was interviewed by Nature for an `article on bicycle
dynamics`_. Additionally, I maintain a blog_ with scholarly posts and social
media accounts where I post engineering and scholarly materials. Lastly, I led
a workshop on computer skills in a remote village in Kenya.

Acknowledgements
================

I know this document is supposed to be about my accomplishments but I think it
is important to note the people that contributed to the success of the above
mentioned activities. The MAE staff has been superb in their support and help,
especially with the MAE Design Studio work. In particular Felicia Smith, Dave
Richardson, Jacob Kitada, Loan-Anh Nguyen, and Rob Kamisky played important
roles. My teaching assistants, Matthew Lefort and Farhad Ghadamli, were
excellent. I couldn't have done any of the extra classroom innovations without
their help and great ideas. I've had two excellent undergraduate assistants:
Vivian Tran and Braden Tinucci. Both Michael Hill and Steven Velinsky have been
especially helpful and attentive mentors. I also appreciate the dedication and
time contributed by all of the EME |_| 185 project sponsors. And finally, I
thank the SymPy and PyDy development teams.
