Teaching and Learning
=====================

   Teach more courses than normal faculty.

   a. Pedagogical or curricular innovation, including: the development of new
      instructional materials such as audio-visual units, online course
      materials; major curricular revisions; introduction of innovative
      teaching techniques; development of online or hybrid courses.
   b. Use of longitudinal measurements to demonstrate impacts of the
      candidate's teaching on students' learning outcomes, including their
      gains in mastery of course content, changes in attitude towards content,
      improvement in critical thinking, or development of stronger
      communication skills.
   c. Demonstration of reflective practice, including the informed use of data
      to monitor and assess student learning. Descriptions of these efforts
      should include the reasoning for adopting specific teaching approaches,
      how feedback from students was solicited and used, and the rationale for
      instituting changes in teaching
   d. Peer review of teaching by faculty, including evaluation of classroom and
      online materials. See UCD 220 for additional information on peer review
      of teaching.

University and Public Service
-----------------------------

a. Service (with dates and responsibilities identified) in departmental,
   college, Academic Senate and administrative capacities. Evaluation of the
   quality of service and contributions made in these areas is expected.
b. Academic leadership within the University. A Lecturer SOE or Senior Lecturer
   SOE who serves as department or program chair is entitled to the same
   recognition accorded ladder-rank faculty who serve in this role (see APM
   245-11). Academic leadership in other roles should be recognized similarly,
   especially when such leadership provides evidence of innovative professional
   contributions. Examples of such accomplishments include leadership in
   reforming curricula, the development of innovative advising programs, or
   creation of new programs establishing links to public schools.
c. Community (regional, state, national, international) service based upon
   professional expertise.
d. Contributions to student welfare on the UC Davis campus or UC system-wide.
e. Professionally based outreach to other educational entities such as K-12
   schools, museums, clubs, etc.
f. Communication to the public based on professional expertise.
